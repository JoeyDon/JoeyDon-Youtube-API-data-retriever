His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has continued to race in the series, racking up numerous overall wins as well as plenty of podium appearances. He’s also accumulated five X Games medals since the start of his career, including most recently taking silver at Global X Games Barcelona RallyCross in 2013. In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful viral Gymkhana series of videos.",

Get yours before they are gone at https://www.fsmgarage.com.\n\nThere is a place not far from me where the freedom echoes off the rooftops of lakefront houses, where men dare to blast across water in machines made of fiberglass, with engine's so large that the boats nearly sink under the weight of their awesomeness. We journey to Waterloo, South Carolina, to witness the spectacle of 30 hot road boats ripping across water with supercharged V8 engines belching the music of our people through open headers. It was all part of Leonard Pope's Waterloo Boogaloo hot boat party and it was incredible!\nWe saw jet boats, v-drives, tunnel hulls and hydros and we put more miles in a single day behind the wheel of Game Over than we have since its maiden voyage earlier this year. There was a food truck and live music by Testarossa, who graciously allowed us to use its tunes for the soundtrack to this video you can find them at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhmKsKVaqhZaffF7P1QYag. Hopefully we can all get together again next year for another installment of this epic day on the water. \n\n-Finnegan",

Audacity is good free audio software, and Pencil2D is free animation software that should be good enough to learn with.\n\nHave a great day! :)",

    "videoTitle": "Why You Couldn’t Afford To Fly Concorde",
    "videoDescription": "Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you’ll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustard\n\nConcorde was the world’s most iconic airliner and one of the most technically ambitious projects in aviation history. Billions were spent on its development over a span of more than a decade. When the Concorde program was launched, it was to be the next giant leap forward in air travel. Many believed that mass supersonic commercial air travel would be commonplace by the end of the 1970s. \n\nBy the early 1960s, both the British and French had come up with early designs for supersonic airliners. As both efforts moved toward the prototype phase, it increasingly made sense for the two countries to work together to shoulder development costs and the immense technical hurdles. Britain and France formally partnered to launch the Concorde program by signing a treaty in 1962.\n\nThousands of the brightest French and British engineers were dedicated to making supersonic air travel a reality. By 1963, mockups of Concorde were already capturing the world’s imagination and dazzling the press. Airlines soon placed orders for more than 70 Concordes. Orders were expected to grow to at least 200 by 1975.  The Soviet Union responded with the development of their own supersonic airliner and the United States launched the Supersonic Transport program. \n\nHowever, by the early 1970s, the prospect of mass supersonic travel began to fade. Concorde would enter commercial service in the mid-to-late 1970s, just as the price of oil began to skyrocket. Concorde burned nearly four times more fuel than even a first generation jetliner. Like all supersonic aircraft, Concorde generated sonic booms. Public tolerance for sonic booms had been underestimated, and as countries started banning supersonic flights over their airspace, limited route options made Concorde less appealing to airlines. By the end of 1973, nearly every airline cancelled their options. All the while, Concorde’s development costs had ballooned to more than ten times original estimates. \n\nBritish Airways and Air France were ultimately the only airlines to put Concordes into service, taking delivery of just a handful of aircraft each.  The two airlines would eventually turn a profit by branding Concorde as an ultra-exclusive way to travel. Ticket prices were set as high as $12,000 for a London to New York round trip for the elite few who could afford the price of flying supersonic. While the prospect of mass supersonic travel never arrived, Concorde earned a legacy as an engineering marvel and symbol of pride for the British and French until it's retirement in 2003.\n\nSelect footage courtesy the AP Archive:\nAP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovietone\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:\nhttps://twitter.com/airhrt_\n\nLink to the Mustard Store:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\nIntro Song:  “Upbeat Jazz” - https://audiojungle.net/item/upbeat-jazz/19560759\n\nSong 2:    “British Loop” - https://audiojungle.net/item/british-loop/3940093\n\nSong 3:    “Future Innovation Technology” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/105925303-future-innovation-technologyinspirational-science-and-indust \n\nSong 4:  “Documentary Curious And Contemporary” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/124518398-documentary-curious-and-contemporary-60-sec-part-2\n\nSong 5:   “80s Synthwave” - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-synthwave/25916576\n\nSong 6:   “Raw Cello” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/120023244-raw-cello-virtuoso-dramatic-solo-strings-epic-inspiring-cine\n\nSong 7:   “Ambient Piano Documentary” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/123770319-ambient-piano-documentary\n\nSong 8:   “Inspirational Technology” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/100434966-inspirational-technologyfuture-and-fantasyscience-and-produc\n\nSong 9:   “80s Synthwave”\nhttps://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave/26328368",

It comes with front and rear bumpers, side skirts, canards, a cf hood, and a rear wing. They also bought a set of $600 carbon fiber mirrors from Chargespeed. Shout out to our boy Tony at SocalZ who managed to track one down a wing for us that was hiding in a back room and sold it to us just in time to make this episode.\n\nNolan and Aaron are getting a $300 Duraflex N1 Body Kit. Dude, $300!! But it didn’t come with a sweet hood or wing like Hi-car’s kit did. SO, they got  a gigantic Street Faction wing and a JGTC  inspired carbon fiber hood. The wing itself was $800, which makes the wing officially the most expensive thing on Low Car. The CF hood was $540 -- It was the cheapest one we could find. Oh, and they also got some eBay KNOCKOFF ganador mirrors for $40.\n\nBody Kits are one of the coolest mods you can do to your car because it really changes the way the car looks, it almost feels like you own a new car! \n\nIs all the extra money Team Hi is throwing at their body kit actually gonna make it look THAT much better than Low Car? \n\nCheck out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHU\r\n\r\nSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!\r\n►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvO\r\n\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/\r\n\r\nClick here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/\r\n\r\nDonut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

    "videoDescription": "A world first. New footage from Mars rendered in stunning 4K resolution. We also talk about the cameras on board the Martian rovers and how we made the video. \n\nThe cameras on board the rovers were the height of technology when the respective missions launched.\n\nA question often asked is: \n‘Why don’t we actually have live video from Mars?’\n\nAlthough the cameras are high quality, the rate at which the rovers can send data back to earth is the biggest challenge. Curiosity can only send data directly back to earth at 32 kilo-bits per second. \n\nInstead, when the rover can connect to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we get more favourable speeds of 2 Megabytes per second. \n\nHowever, this link is only available for about 8 minutes each Sol, or Martian day. \n\nAs you would expect, sending HD video at these speeds would take a long long time. As nothing really moves on Mars, it makes more sense to take and send back images. \n\nCredit: NASA\nMusic from Epidemic Sound",

Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park artist grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.\n\nHis early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles \"Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)\" and \"All Girls Are the Same\". Both tracks would also land on his official debut full-length album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018.",

I sincerely hope you enjoy it.\nThis is a completely fan video.\nOn my patreon,  https://www.patreon.com/Primaris you can see the \"backstage\" of creating a video, various materials from Wallpapers to videos about creating soon. \nIf you want to support creating videos, I would be very grateful. This will help me speed up and focus on creating a new part.\n\nI worked on the production of the video from the beginning to the end and I hope you will appreciate the work that have done.\n\nAt this point, I have started the next part. . There will still be 3 of them associated with these characters. In the next parts, I will show the Necrons and the tomb. No spoilers)\nThere will be action and the overall visual will be much better. This video was for me some was a techno demo. I realized what I was weak at, and where I made mistakes, and after analyzing all this, I started working on a new video.\n\nI am very grateful to the entire Warhammer community and social networks. During production, I felt tremendous support and I want to say thank you!\nI promise the next videos will be much better!\n\nI also express my gratitude to the Creator of the Astartes channel-Syama Pedersen for inspiration. His work is mind-blowing. I was inspired by his videos.\n\npleasant viewing!\nNo Pity! No Remorse! No Fear!\n\nВсем привет.\n Представляю вам свой новый  проект - Примарис-черные храмовники. Это первый ролик про черных храмовников, который я  искренне надеюсь вам понравится.\nЭто полностью фан ролик. \n\nВ ближайшее время на моем патреоне https://www.patreon.com/Primaris вы сможете увидеть \"закульсье\" создания ролика, различные материалы от обоев до роликов о создании.\nЕсли вы хотите поддержать создание роликов, я буду очень признателен. Это поможет мне ускориться и сфокусироваться на создании новой части. \n\nНад производством ролика  от начала и  до конца работал только я. Надеюсь вы оцените проделанную работу.\n\nНа данный момент, я начал работать над следующей частью. Их еще будет 3, связанных с данными персонажами. В следующих частях, я покажу некронов и гробницу. Без спойлеров -)\nБудет экшн и общий визуал будет намного лучше. Данный ролик, был для меня некой технодемо. Я понял в чем я слаб, и где совершаю ошибки, проанализировав все это, я положил начало работы над  новым роликом. \n\nЯ очень благодарен всему комьюнити вархаммер и  соц сетям. За время производства, я чувствовал колоссальную поддержку и хочу сказать спасибо!\nОбещаю следующие ролики будут намного лучше!\n\nТак же выражаю благодарность создателю канала Astartes -Syama Pedersen за вдохновение. Его работы, просто взрывают мозг. Я был вдохновлен его роликами. \n\nПриятного просмотра!\nБез жалости! Без сожалений! Без Страха!\n\n\n\n#Warhammer #Paxelart\n#Blacktemplars #Warhammer40k #Primaris",

    "videoDescription": "We took a small break from wrenching on cars because it's super hot in Georgia right now and instead worked on stuff that we could play on the lake with. I've had a 1994 Yamaha Waverunner Superjet for about 10 years now and next to my jet boat, it's the most fun thing to ever rip the water. After searching high and low for a 2020 model Superjet, I found one of the last SJ's for sale in the USA in Florida. The good homie Cletus McFarland was kind enough to pick it up from the dealer and deliver it to me. I jokingly suggested he use Leroy the Savage to pick up the new ride but I didn't think he'd actually do it. \n\nNow we have two stand-up PWC and no good way to transport them. So, we bought a cheap motorcycle trailer and modded it to carry both bikes and PWC! Skip to the end of the vid to see the on-water action or watch the whole thing to get ideas for your own conversion. \n\nStay tuned for a heads-up comparison between the old Yamaha Superjet and the new one soon!\n\nwant a shirt, hat or stickers? go here: https://www.fsmgarage.com",

    "channelDescription": "Hello there,\nWelcome to my historical sewing adventures!\n\nGenerally the garments I study (and thus, the content I produce) range from early Medieval through Edwardian: anything and everything before the widespread use of the electric sewing machine. My goal is to investigate the practices and materials used throughout history in order to better understand the clothes themselves, as well as the people who wore them. I do also make most of my everyday clothes myself--reflecting historical details, of course--so there's a bit of that round here as well.\n\nSo whether you're here here for the history--or instead wish to learn a bit of the historical origins behind these garments before adapting them to your modern needs, I bid you warmest welcomes!",

Blaine’s stunts defy the boundaries of human endurance, each one becoming more death-defying than the last.   In addition to the many millions who have seen him on television, Blaine has also performed live for audiences of over 20,000 in arenas around the world. He has performed intimately for every sitting American president including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as a number of international leaders and prominent figures such as Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, Stephen Hawking, Muhammad Ali, among others. His TED talk became one of Bill Gates’ personal favorites, and is widely considered the most revealing testimony Blaine has ever given on the topic of his remarkable career.",

Today we are looking at the return of Leeds United to the Premier League, following a chequered history that saw them almost collapse in 2007.\n\nWe break down what actually happened 16 years ago, and how financial difficulties saw them fall into the Championship and League One, from where they struggled to return. \n\nThe arrival of new Italian ownership in 2013 bought with it the promise of success, but we look at how it wasn’t until Marcelo Bielsa arrived in 2018 that hope once again gripped the famous old West Yorkshire club.\n\nWe look at the Argentines unique tactics, and how he has got the best out of the squad he was given, including the brilliant Jack Harrison and Kalvin Philips. \n\nLeeds United are a Premier League club again, and here is how that happened!\n\n\n► LISTEN TO: EXTRA TIME PODCAST: https://apple.co/2KaVq0K\n\n► FIND OUT MORE ABOUT XG & OTHER STATS FROM OUR FRIENDS 'STATS BOMB' https://statsbomb.com/articles/",

His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has continued to race in the series, racking up numerous overall wins as well as plenty of podium appearances. He’s also accumulated five X Games medals since the start of his career, including most recently taking silver at Global X Games Barcelona RallyCross in 2013. In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful viral Gymkhana series of videos.",

Get yours before they are gone at https://www.fsmgarage.com.\n\nThere is a place not far from me where the freedom echoes off the rooftops of lakefront houses, where men dare to blast across water in machines made of fiberglass, with engine's so large that the boats nearly sink under the weight of their awesomeness. We journey to Waterloo, South Carolina, to witness the spectacle of 30 hot road boats ripping across water with supercharged V8 engines belching the music of our people through open headers. It was all part of Leonard Pope's Waterloo Boogaloo hot boat party and it was incredible!\nWe saw jet boats, v-drives, tunnel hulls and hydros and we put more miles in a single day behind the wheel of Game Over than we have since its maiden voyage earlier this year. There was a food truck and live music by Testarossa, who graciously allowed us to use its tunes for the soundtrack to this video you can find them at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhmKsKVaqhZaffF7P1QYag. Hopefully we can all get together again next year for another installment of this epic day on the water. \n\n-Finnegan",

Audacity is good free audio software, and Pencil2D is free animation software that should be good enough to learn with.\n\nHave a great day! :)",

    "videoTitle": "Why You Couldn’t Afford To Fly Concorde",
    "videoDescription": "Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you’ll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustard\n\nConcorde was the world’s most iconic airliner and one of the most technically ambitious projects in aviation history. Billions were spent on its development over a span of more than a decade. When the Concorde program was launched, it was to be the next giant leap forward in air travel. Many believed that mass supersonic commercial air travel would be commonplace by the end of the 1970s. \n\nBy the early 1960s, both the British and French had come up with early designs for supersonic airliners. As both efforts moved toward the prototype phase, it increasingly made sense for the two countries to work together to shoulder development costs and the immense technical hurdles. Britain and France formally partnered to launch the Concorde program by signing a treaty in 1962.\n\nThousands of the brightest French and British engineers were dedicated to making supersonic air travel a reality. By 1963, mockups of Concorde were already capturing the world’s imagination and dazzling the press. Airlines soon placed orders for more than 70 Concordes. Orders were expected to grow to at least 200 by 1975.  The Soviet Union responded with the development of their own supersonic airliner and the United States launched the Supersonic Transport program. \n\nHowever, by the early 1970s, the prospect of mass supersonic travel began to fade. Concorde would enter commercial service in the mid-to-late 1970s, just as the price of oil began to skyrocket. Concorde burned nearly four times more fuel than even a first generation jetliner. Like all supersonic aircraft, Concorde generated sonic booms. Public tolerance for sonic booms had been underestimated, and as countries started banning supersonic flights over their airspace, limited route options made Concorde less appealing to airlines. By the end of 1973, nearly every airline cancelled their options. All the while, Concorde’s development costs had ballooned to more than ten times original estimates. \n\nBritish Airways and Air France were ultimately the only airlines to put Concordes into service, taking delivery of just a handful of aircraft each.  The two airlines would eventually turn a profit by branding Concorde as an ultra-exclusive way to travel. Ticket prices were set as high as $12,000 for a London to New York round trip for the elite few who could afford the price of flying supersonic. While the prospect of mass supersonic travel never arrived, Concorde earned a legacy as an engineering marvel and symbol of pride for the British and French until it's retirement in 2003.\n\nSelect footage courtesy the AP Archive:\nAP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovietone\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:\nhttps://twitter.com/airhrt_\n\nLink to the Mustard Store:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\nIntro Song:  “Upbeat Jazz” - https://audiojungle.net/item/upbeat-jazz/19560759\n\nSong 2:    “British Loop” - https://audiojungle.net/item/british-loop/3940093\n\nSong 3:    “Future Innovation Technology” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/105925303-future-innovation-technologyinspirational-science-and-indust \n\nSong 4:  “Documentary Curious And Contemporary” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/124518398-documentary-curious-and-contemporary-60-sec-part-2\n\nSong 5:   “80s Synthwave” - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-synthwave/25916576\n\nSong 6:   “Raw Cello” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/120023244-raw-cello-virtuoso-dramatic-solo-strings-epic-inspiring-cine\n\nSong 7:   “Ambient Piano Documentary” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/123770319-ambient-piano-documentary\n\nSong 8:   “Inspirational Technology” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/100434966-inspirational-technologyfuture-and-fantasyscience-and-produc\n\nSong 9:   “80s Synthwave”\nhttps://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave/26328368",

    "videoDescription": "Team Hi and Team Low are installing BODY KITS!\n\nJames and Zach are getting a $5,500 C-West body kit built by the JDM Gods themselves! It comes with front and rear bumpers, side skirts, canards, a cf hood, and a rear wing. They also bought a set of $600 carbon fiber mirrors from Chargespeed. Shout out to our boy Tony at SocalZ who managed to track one down a wing for us that was hiding in a back room and sold it to us just in time to make this episode.\n\nNolan and Aaron are getting a $300 Duraflex N1 Body Kit. Dude, $300!! But it didn’t come with a sweet hood or wing like Hi-car’s kit did. SO, they got  a gigantic Street Faction wing and a JGTC  inspired carbon fiber hood. The wing itself was $800, which makes the wing officially the most expensive thing on Low Car. The CF hood was $540 -- It was the cheapest one we could find. Oh, and they also got some eBay KNOCKOFF ganador mirrors for $40.\n\nBody Kits are one of the coolest mods you can do to your car because it really changes the way the car looks, it almost feels like you own a new car! \n\nIs all the extra money Team Hi is throwing at their body kit actually gonna make it look THAT much better than Low Car? \n\nCheck out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHU\r\n\r\nSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!\r\n►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvO\r\n\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/\r\n\r\nClick here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/\r\n\r\nDonut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

    "videoDescription": "A world first. New footage from Mars rendered in stunning 4K resolution. We also talk about the cameras on board the Martian rovers and how we made the video. \n\nThe cameras on board the rovers were the height of technology when the respective missions launched.\n\nA question often asked is: \n‘Why don’t we actually have live video from Mars?’\n\nAlthough the cameras are high quality, the rate at which the rovers can send data back to earth is the biggest challenge. Curiosity can only send data directly back to earth at 32 kilo-bits per second. \n\nInstead, when the rover can connect to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we get more favourable speeds of 2 Megabytes per second. \n\nHowever, this link is only available for about 8 minutes each Sol, or Martian day. \n\nAs you would expect, sending HD video at these speeds would take a long long time. As nothing really moves on Mars, it makes more sense to take and send back images. \n\nCredit: NASA\nMusic from Epidemic Sound",

Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park artist grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.\n\nHis early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles \"Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)\" and \"All Girls Are the Same\". Both tracks would also land on his official debut full-length album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018.",

I sincerely hope you enjoy it.\nThis is a completely fan video.\nOn my patreon,  https://www.patreon.com/Primaris you can see the \"backstage\" of creating a video, various materials from Wallpapers to videos about creating soon. \nIf you want to support creating videos, I would be very grateful. This will help me speed up and focus on creating a new part.\n\nI worked on the production of the video from the beginning to the end and I hope you will appreciate the work that have done.\n\nAt this point, I have started the next part. . There will still be 3 of them associated with these characters. In the next parts, I will show the Necrons and the tomb. No spoilers)\nThere will be action and the overall visual will be much better. This video was for me some was a techno demo. I realized what I was weak at, and where I made mistakes, and after analyzing all this, I started working on a new video.\n\nI am very grateful to the entire Warhammer community and social networks. During production, I felt tremendous support and I want to say thank you!\nI promise the next videos will be much better!\n\nI also express my gratitude to the Creator of the Astartes channel-Syama Pedersen for inspiration. His work is mind-blowing. I was inspired by his videos.\n\npleasant viewing!\nNo Pity! No Remorse! No Fear!\n\nВсем привет.\n Представляю вам свой новый  проект - Примарис-черные храмовники. Это первый ролик про черных храмовников, который я  искренне надеюсь вам понравится.\nЭто полностью фан ролик. \n\nВ ближайшее время на моем патреоне https://www.patreon.com/Primaris вы сможете увидеть \"закульсье\" создания ролика, различные материалы от обоев до роликов о создании.\nЕсли вы хотите поддержать создание роликов, я буду очень признателен. Это поможет мне ускориться и сфокусироваться на создании новой части. \n\nНад производством ролика  от начала и  до конца работал только я. Надеюсь вы оцените проделанную работу.\n\nНа данный момент, я начал работать над следующей частью. Их еще будет 3, связанных с данными персонажами. В следующих частях, я покажу некронов и гробницу. Без спойлеров -)\nБудет экшн и общий визуал будет намного лучше. Данный ролик, был для меня некой технодемо. Я понял в чем я слаб, и где совершаю ошибки, проанализировав все это, я положил начало работы над  новым роликом. \n\nЯ очень благодарен всему комьюнити вархаммер и  соц сетям. За время производства, я чувствовал колоссальную поддержку и хочу сказать спасибо!\nОбещаю следующие ролики будут намного лучше!\n\nТак же выражаю благодарность создателю канала Astartes -Syama Pedersen за вдохновение. Его работы, просто взрывают мозг. Я был вдохновлен его роликами. \n\nПриятного просмотра!\nБез жалости! Без сожалений! Без Страха!\n\n\n\n#Warhammer #Paxelart\n#Blacktemplars #Warhammer40k #Primaris",

    "videoDescription": "We took a small break from wrenching on cars because it's super hot in Georgia right now and instead worked on stuff that we could play on the lake with. I've had a 1994 Yamaha Waverunner Superjet for about 10 years now and next to my jet boat, it's the most fun thing to ever rip the water. After searching high and low for a 2020 model Superjet, I found one of the last SJ's for sale in the USA in Florida. The good homie Cletus McFarland was kind enough to pick it up from the dealer and deliver it to me. I jokingly suggested he use Leroy the Savage to pick up the new ride but I didn't think he'd actually do it. \n\nNow we have two stand-up PWC and no good way to transport them. So, we bought a cheap motorcycle trailer and modded it to carry both bikes and PWC! Skip to the end of the vid to see the on-water action or watch the whole thing to get ideas for your own conversion. \n\nStay tuned for a heads-up comparison between the old Yamaha Superjet and the new one soon!\n\nwant a shirt, hat or stickers? go here: https://www.fsmgarage.com",

    "channelDescription": "Hello there,\nWelcome to my historical sewing adventures!\n\nGenerally the garments I study (and thus, the content I produce) range from early Medieval through Edwardian: anything and everything before the widespread use of the electric sewing machine. My goal is to investigate the practices and materials used throughout history in order to better understand the clothes themselves, as well as the people who wore them. I do also make most of my everyday clothes myself--reflecting historical details, of course--so there's a bit of that round here as well.\n\nSo whether you're here here for the history--or instead wish to learn a bit of the historical origins behind these garments before adapting them to your modern needs, I bid you warmest welcomes!",

Blaine’s stunts defy the boundaries of human endurance, each one becoming more death-defying than the last.   In addition to the many millions who have seen him on television, Blaine has also performed live for audiences of over 20,000 in arenas around the world. He has performed intimately for every sitting American president including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as a number of international leaders and prominent figures such as Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, Stephen Hawking, Muhammad Ali, among others. His TED talk became one of Bill Gates’ personal favorites, and is widely considered the most revealing testimony Blaine has ever given on the topic of his remarkable career.",

Today we are looking at the return of Leeds United to the Premier League, following a chequered history that saw them almost collapse in 2007.\n\nWe break down what actually happened 16 years ago, and how financial difficulties saw them fall into the Championship and League One, from where they struggled to return. \n\nThe arrival of new Italian ownership in 2013 bought with it the promise of success, but we look at how it wasn’t until Marcelo Bielsa arrived in 2018 that hope once again gripped the famous old West Yorkshire club.\n\nWe look at the Argentines unique tactics, and how he has got the best out of the squad he was given, including the brilliant Jack Harrison and Kalvin Philips. \n\nLeeds United are a Premier League club again, and here is how that happened!\n\n\n► LISTEN TO: EXTRA TIME PODCAST: https://apple.co/2KaVq0K\n\n► FIND OUT MORE ABOUT XG & OTHER STATS FROM OUR FRIENDS 'STATS BOMB' https://statsbomb.com/articles/",

His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has continued to race in the series, racking up numerous overall wins as well as plenty of podium appearances. He’s also accumulated five X Games medals since the start of his career, including most recently taking silver at Global X Games Barcelona RallyCross in 2013. In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful viral Gymkhana series of videos.",

Get yours before they are gone at https://www.fsmgarage.com.\n\nThere is a place not far from me where the freedom echoes off the rooftops of lakefront houses, where men dare to blast across water in machines made of fiberglass, with engine's so large that the boats nearly sink under the weight of their awesomeness. We journey to Waterloo, South Carolina, to witness the spectacle of 30 hot road boats ripping across water with supercharged V8 engines belching the music of our people through open headers. It was all part of Leonard Pope's Waterloo Boogaloo hot boat party and it was incredible!\nWe saw jet boats, v-drives, tunnel hulls and hydros and we put more miles in a single day behind the wheel of Game Over than we have since its maiden voyage earlier this year. There was a food truck and live music by Testarossa, who graciously allowed us to use its tunes for the soundtrack to this video you can find them at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhmKsKVaqhZaffF7P1QYag. Hopefully we can all get together again next year for another installment of this epic day on the water. \n\n-Finnegan",

Audacity is good free audio software, and Pencil2D is free animation software that should be good enough to learn with.\n\nHave a great day! :)",

    "videoTitle": "Why You Couldn’t Afford To Fly Concorde",
    "videoDescription": "Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you’ll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustard\n\nConcorde was the world’s most iconic airliner and one of the most technically ambitious projects in aviation history. Billions were spent on its development over a span of more than a decade. When the Concorde program was launched, it was to be the next giant leap forward in air travel. Many believed that mass supersonic commercial air travel would be commonplace by the end of the 1970s. \n\nBy the early 1960s, both the British and French had come up with early designs for supersonic airliners. As both efforts moved toward the prototype phase, it increasingly made sense for the two countries to work together to shoulder development costs and the immense technical hurdles. Britain and France formally partnered to launch the Concorde program by signing a treaty in 1962.\n\nThousands of the brightest French and British engineers were dedicated to making supersonic air travel a reality. By 1963, mockups of Concorde were already capturing the world’s imagination and dazzling the press. Airlines soon placed orders for more than 70 Concordes. Orders were expected to grow to at least 200 by 1975.  The Soviet Union responded with the development of their own supersonic airliner and the United States launched the Supersonic Transport program. \n\nHowever, by the early 1970s, the prospect of mass supersonic travel began to fade. Concorde would enter commercial service in the mid-to-late 1970s, just as the price of oil began to skyrocket. Concorde burned nearly four times more fuel than even a first generation jetliner. Like all supersonic aircraft, Concorde generated sonic booms. Public tolerance for sonic booms had been underestimated, and as countries started banning supersonic flights over their airspace, limited route options made Concorde less appealing to airlines. By the end of 1973, nearly every airline cancelled their options. All the while, Concorde’s development costs had ballooned to more than ten times original estimates. \n\nBritish Airways and Air France were ultimately the only airlines to put Concordes into service, taking delivery of just a handful of aircraft each.  The two airlines would eventually turn a profit by branding Concorde as an ultra-exclusive way to travel. Ticket prices were set as high as $12,000 for a London to New York round trip for the elite few who could afford the price of flying supersonic. While the prospect of mass supersonic travel never arrived, Concorde earned a legacy as an engineering marvel and symbol of pride for the British and French until it's retirement in 2003.\n\nSelect footage courtesy the AP Archive:\nAP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovietone\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:\nhttps://twitter.com/airhrt_\n\nLink to the Mustard Store:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\nIntro Song:  “Upbeat Jazz” - https://audiojungle.net/item/upbeat-jazz/19560759\n\nSong 2:    “British Loop” - https://audiojungle.net/item/british-loop/3940093\n\nSong 3:    “Future Innovation Technology” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/105925303-future-innovation-technologyinspirational-science-and-indust \n\nSong 4:  “Documentary Curious And Contemporary” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/124518398-documentary-curious-and-contemporary-60-sec-part-2\n\nSong 5:   “80s Synthwave” - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-synthwave/25916576\n\nSong 6:   “Raw Cello” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/120023244-raw-cello-virtuoso-dramatic-solo-strings-epic-inspiring-cine\n\nSong 7:   “Ambient Piano Documentary” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/123770319-ambient-piano-documentary\n\nSong 8:   “Inspirational Technology” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/100434966-inspirational-technologyfuture-and-fantasyscience-and-produc\n\nSong 9:   “80s Synthwave”\nhttps://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave/26328368",

It comes with front and rear bumpers, side skirts, canards, a cf hood, and a rear wing. They also bought a set of $600 carbon fiber mirrors from Chargespeed. Shout out to our boy Tony at SocalZ who managed to track one down a wing for us that was hiding in a back room and sold it to us just in time to make this episode.\n\nNolan and Aaron are getting a $300 Duraflex N1 Body Kit. Dude, $300!! But it didn’t come with a sweet hood or wing like Hi-car’s kit did. SO, they got  a gigantic Street Faction wing and a JGTC  inspired carbon fiber hood. The wing itself was $800, which makes the wing officially the most expensive thing on Low Car. The CF hood was $540 -- It was the cheapest one we could find. Oh, and they also got some eBay KNOCKOFF ganador mirrors for $40.\n\nBody Kits are one of the coolest mods you can do to your car because it really changes the way the car looks, it almost feels like you own a new car! \n\nIs all the extra money Team Hi is throwing at their body kit actually gonna make it look THAT much better than Low Car? \n\nCheck out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHU\r\n\r\nSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!\r\n►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvO\r\n\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/\r\n\r\nClick here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/\r\n\r\nDonut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

    "videoDescription": "A world first. New footage from Mars rendered in stunning 4K resolution. We also talk about the cameras on board the Martian rovers and how we made the video. \n\nThe cameras on board the rovers were the height of technology when the respective missions launched.\n\nA question often asked is: \n‘Why don’t we actually have live video from Mars?’\n\nAlthough the cameras are high quality, the rate at which the rovers can send data back to earth is the biggest challenge. Curiosity can only send data directly back to earth at 32 kilo-bits per second. \n\nInstead, when the rover can connect to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we get more favourable speeds of 2 Megabytes per second. \n\nHowever, this link is only available for about 8 minutes each Sol, or Martian day. \n\nAs you would expect, sending HD video at these speeds would take a long long time. As nothing really moves on Mars, it makes more sense to take and send back images. \n\nCredit: NASA\nMusic from Epidemic Sound",

Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park artist grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.\n\nHis early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles \"Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)\" and \"All Girls Are the Same\". Both tracks would also land on his official debut full-length album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018.",

I sincerely hope you enjoy it.\nThis is a completely fan video.\nOn my patreon,  https://www.patreon.com/Primaris you can see the \"backstage\" of creating a video, various materials from Wallpapers to videos about creating soon. \nIf you want to support creating videos, I would be very grateful. This will help me speed up and focus on creating a new part.\n\nI worked on the production of the video from the beginning to the end and I hope you will appreciate the work that have done.\n\nAt this point, I have started the next part. . There will still be 3 of them associated with these characters. In the next parts, I will show the Necrons and the tomb. No spoilers)\nThere will be action and the overall visual will be much better. This video was for me some was a techno demo. I realized what I was weak at, and where I made mistakes, and after analyzing all this, I started working on a new video.\n\nI am very grateful to the entire Warhammer community and social networks. During production, I felt tremendous support and I want to say thank you!\nI promise the next videos will be much better!\n\nI also express my gratitude to the Creator of the Astartes channel-Syama Pedersen for inspiration. His work is mind-blowing. I was inspired by his videos.\n\npleasant viewing!\nNo Pity! No Remorse! No Fear!\n\nВсем привет.\n Представляю вам свой новый  проект - Примарис-черные храмовники. Это первый ролик про черных храмовников, который я  искренне надеюсь вам понравится.\nЭто полностью фан ролик. \n\nВ ближайшее время на моем патреоне https://www.patreon.com/Primaris вы сможете увидеть \"закульсье\" создания ролика, различные материалы от обоев до роликов о создании.\nЕсли вы хотите поддержать создание роликов, я буду очень признателен. Это поможет мне ускориться и сфокусироваться на создании новой части. \n\nНад производством ролика  от начала и  до конца работал только я. Надеюсь вы оцените проделанную работу.\n\nНа данный момент, я начал работать над следующей частью. Их еще будет 3, связанных с данными персонажами. В следующих частях, я покажу некронов и гробницу. Без спойлеров -)\nБудет экшн и общий визуал будет намного лучше. Данный ролик, был для меня некой технодемо. Я понял в чем я слаб, и где совершаю ошибки, проанализировав все это, я положил начало работы над  новым роликом. \n\nЯ очень благодарен всему комьюнити вархаммер и  соц сетям. За время производства, я чувствовал колоссальную поддержку и хочу сказать спасибо!\nОбещаю следующие ролики будут намного лучше!\n\nТак же выражаю благодарность создателю канала Astartes -Syama Pedersen за вдохновение. Его работы, просто взрывают мозг. Я был вдохновлен его роликами. \n\nПриятного просмотра!\nБез жалости! Без сожалений! Без Страха!\n\n\n\n#Warhammer #Paxelart\n#Blacktemplars #Warhammer40k #Primaris",

    "videoDescription": "We took a small break from wrenching on cars because it's super hot in Georgia right now and instead worked on stuff that we could play on the lake with. I've had a 1994 Yamaha Waverunner Superjet for about 10 years now and next to my jet boat, it's the most fun thing to ever rip the water. After searching high and low for a 2020 model Superjet, I found one of the last SJ's for sale in the USA in Florida. The good homie Cletus McFarland was kind enough to pick it up from the dealer and deliver it to me. I jokingly suggested he use Leroy the Savage to pick up the new ride but I didn't think he'd actually do it. \n\nNow we have two stand-up PWC and no good way to transport them. So, we bought a cheap motorcycle trailer and modded it to carry both bikes and PWC! Skip to the end of the vid to see the on-water action or watch the whole thing to get ideas for your own conversion. \n\nStay tuned for a heads-up comparison between the old Yamaha Superjet and the new one soon!\n\nwant a shirt, hat or stickers? go here: https://www.fsmgarage.com",

My goal is to investigate the practices and materials used throughout history in order to better understand the clothes themselves, as well as the people who wore them. I do also make most of my everyday clothes myself--reflecting historical details, of course--so there's a bit of that round here as well.\n\nSo whether you're here here for the history--or instead wish to learn a bit of the historical origins behind these garments before adapting them to your modern needs, I bid you warmest welcomes!",

Blaine’s stunts defy the boundaries of human endurance, each one becoming more death-defying than the last.   In addition to the many millions who have seen him on television, Blaine has also performed live for audiences of over 20,000 in arenas around the world. He has performed intimately for every sitting American president including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as a number of international leaders and prominent figures such as Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, Stephen Hawking, Muhammad Ali, among others. His TED talk became one of Bill Gates’ personal favorites, and is widely considered the most revealing testimony Blaine has ever given on the topic of his remarkable career.",

Today we are looking at the return of Leeds United to the Premier League, following a chequered history that saw them almost collapse in 2007.\n\nWe break down what actually happened 16 years ago, and how financial difficulties saw them fall into the Championship and League One, from where they struggled to return. \n\nThe arrival of new Italian ownership in 2013 bought with it the promise of success, but we look at how it wasn’t until Marcelo Bielsa arrived in 2018 that hope once again gripped the famous old West Yorkshire club.\n\nWe look at the Argentines unique tactics, and how he has got the best out of the squad he was given, including the brilliant Jack Harrison and Kalvin Philips. \n\nLeeds United are a Premier League club again, and here is how that happened!\n\n\n► LISTEN TO: EXTRA TIME PODCAST: https://apple.co/2KaVq0K\n\n► FIND OUT MORE ABOUT XG & OTHER STATS FROM OUR FRIENDS 'STATS BOMB' https://statsbomb.com/articles/",

His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has continued to race in the series, racking up numerous overall wins as well as plenty of podium appearances. He’s also accumulated five X Games medals since the start of his career, including most recently taking silver at Global X Games Barcelona RallyCross in 2013. In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful viral Gymkhana series of videos.",

Get yours before they are gone at https://www.fsmgarage.com.\n\nThere is a place not far from me where the freedom echoes off the rooftops of lakefront houses, where men dare to blast across water in machines made of fiberglass, with engine's so large that the boats nearly sink under the weight of their awesomeness. We journey to Waterloo, South Carolina, to witness the spectacle of 30 hot road boats ripping across water with supercharged V8 engines belching the music of our people through open headers. It was all part of Leonard Pope's Waterloo Boogaloo hot boat party and it was incredible!\nWe saw jet boats, v-drives, tunnel hulls and hydros and we put more miles in a single day behind the wheel of Game Over than we have since its maiden voyage earlier this year. There was a food truck and live music by Testarossa, who graciously allowed us to use its tunes for the soundtrack to this video you can find them at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhmKsKVaqhZaffF7P1QYag. Hopefully we can all get together again next year for another installment of this epic day on the water. \n\n-Finnegan",

Audacity is good free audio software, and Pencil2D is free animation software that should be good enough to learn with.\n\nHave a great day! :)",

    "videoTitle": "Why You Couldn’t Afford To Fly Concorde",
    "videoDescription": "Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you’ll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustard\n\nConcorde was the world’s most iconic airliner and one of the most technically ambitious projects in aviation history. Billions were spent on its development over a span of more than a decade. When the Concorde program was launched, it was to be the next giant leap forward in air travel. Many believed that mass supersonic commercial air travel would be commonplace by the end of the 1970s. \n\nBy the early 1960s, both the British and French had come up with early designs for supersonic airliners. As both efforts moved toward the prototype phase, it increasingly made sense for the two countries to work together to shoulder development costs and the immense technical hurdles. Britain and France formally partnered to launch the Concorde program by signing a treaty in 1962.\n\nThousands of the brightest French and British engineers were dedicated to making supersonic air travel a reality. By 1963, mockups of Concorde were already capturing the world’s imagination and dazzling the press. Airlines soon placed orders for more than 70 Concordes. Orders were expected to grow to at least 200 by 1975.  The Soviet Union responded with the development of their own supersonic airliner and the United States launched the Supersonic Transport program. \n\nHowever, by the early 1970s, the prospect of mass supersonic travel began to fade. Concorde would enter commercial service in the mid-to-late 1970s, just as the price of oil began to skyrocket. Concorde burned nearly four times more fuel than even a first generation jetliner. Like all supersonic aircraft, Concorde generated sonic booms. Public tolerance for sonic booms had been underestimated, and as countries started banning supersonic flights over their airspace, limited route options made Concorde less appealing to airlines. By the end of 1973, nearly every airline cancelled their options. All the while, Concorde’s development costs had ballooned to more than ten times original estimates. \n\nBritish Airways and Air France were ultimately the only airlines to put Concordes into service, taking delivery of just a handful of aircraft each.  The two airlines would eventually turn a profit by branding Concorde as an ultra-exclusive way to travel. Ticket prices were set as high as $12,000 for a London to New York round trip for the elite few who could afford the price of flying supersonic. While the prospect of mass supersonic travel never arrived, Concorde earned a legacy as an engineering marvel and symbol of pride for the British and French until it's retirement in 2003.\n\nSelect footage courtesy the AP Archive:\nAP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovietone\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:\nhttps://twitter.com/airhrt_\n\nLink to the Mustard Store:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\nIntro Song:  “Upbeat Jazz” - https://audiojungle.net/item/upbeat-jazz/19560759\n\nSong 2:    “British Loop” - https://audiojungle.net/item/british-loop/3940093\n\nSong 3:    “Future Innovation Technology” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/105925303-future-innovation-technologyinspirational-science-and-indust \n\nSong 4:  “Documentary Curious And Contemporary” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/124518398-documentary-curious-and-contemporary-60-sec-part-2\n\nSong 5:   “80s Synthwave” - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-synthwave/25916576\n\nSong 6:   “Raw Cello” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/120023244-raw-cello-virtuoso-dramatic-solo-strings-epic-inspiring-cine\n\nSong 7:   “Ambient Piano Documentary” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/123770319-ambient-piano-documentary\n\nSong 8:   “Inspirational Technology” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/100434966-inspirational-technologyfuture-and-fantasyscience-and-produc\n\nSong 9:   “80s Synthwave”\nhttps://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave/26328368",

It comes with front and rear bumpers, side skirts, canards, a cf hood, and a rear wing. They also bought a set of $600 carbon fiber mirrors from Chargespeed. Shout out to our boy Tony at SocalZ who managed to track one down a wing for us that was hiding in a back room and sold it to us just in time to make this episode.\n\nNolan and Aaron are getting a $300 Duraflex N1 Body Kit. Dude, $300!! But it didn’t come with a sweet hood or wing like Hi-car’s kit did. SO, they got  a gigantic Street Faction wing and a JGTC  inspired carbon fiber hood. The wing itself was $800, which makes the wing officially the most expensive thing on Low Car. The CF hood was $540 -- It was the cheapest one we could find. Oh, and they also got some eBay KNOCKOFF ganador mirrors for $40.\n\nBody Kits are one of the coolest mods you can do to your car because it really changes the way the car looks, it almost feels like you own a new car! \n\nIs all the extra money Team Hi is throwing at their body kit actually gonna make it look THAT much better than Low Car? \n\nCheck out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHU\r\n\r\nSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!\r\n►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvO\r\n\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/\r\n\r\nClick here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/\r\n\r\nDonut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

    "videoDescription": "A world first. New footage from Mars rendered in stunning 4K resolution. We also talk about the cameras on board the Martian rovers and how we made the video. \n\nThe cameras on board the rovers were the height of technology when the respective missions launched.\n\nA question often asked is: \n‘Why don’t we actually have live video from Mars?’\n\nAlthough the cameras are high quality, the rate at which the rovers can send data back to earth is the biggest challenge. Curiosity can only send data directly back to earth at 32 kilo-bits per second. \n\nInstead, when the rover can connect to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we get more favourable speeds of 2 Megabytes per second. \n\nHowever, this link is only available for about 8 minutes each Sol, or Martian day. \n\nAs you would expect, sending HD video at these speeds would take a long long time. As nothing really moves on Mars, it makes more sense to take and send back images. \n\nCredit: NASA\nMusic from Epidemic Sound",

Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park artist grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.\n\nHis early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles \"Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)\" and \"All Girls Are the Same\". Both tracks would also land on his official debut full-length album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018.",

I sincerely hope you enjoy it.\nThis is a completely fan video.\nOn my patreon,  https://www.patreon.com/Primaris you can see the \"backstage\" of creating a video, various materials from Wallpapers to videos about creating soon. \nIf you want to support creating videos, I would be very grateful. This will help me speed up and focus on creating a new part.\n\nI worked on the production of the video from the beginning to the end and I hope you will appreciate the work that have done.\n\nAt this point, I have started the next part. . There will still be 3 of them associated with these characters. In the next parts, I will show the Necrons and the tomb. No spoilers)\nThere will be action and the overall visual will be much better. This video was for me some was a techno demo. I realized what I was weak at, and where I made mistakes, and after analyzing all this, I started working on a new video.\n\nI am very grateful to the entire Warhammer community and social networks. During production, I felt tremendous support and I want to say thank you!\nI promise the next videos will be much better!\n\nI also express my gratitude to the Creator of the Astartes channel-Syama Pedersen for inspiration. His work is mind-blowing. I was inspired by his videos.\n\npleasant viewing!\nNo Pity! No Remorse! No Fear!\n\nВсем привет.\n Представляю вам свой новый  проект - Примарис-черные храмовники. Это первый ролик про черных храмовников, который я  искренне надеюсь вам понравится.\nЭто полностью фан ролик. \n\nВ ближайшее время на моем патреоне https://www.patreon.com/Primaris вы сможете увидеть \"закульсье\" создания ролика, различные материалы от обоев до роликов о создании.\nЕсли вы хотите поддержать создание роликов, я буду очень признателен. Это поможет мне ускориться и сфокусироваться на создании новой части. \n\nНад производством ролика  от начала и  до конца работал только я. Надеюсь вы оцените проделанную работу.\n\nНа данный момент, я начал работать над следующей частью. Их еще будет 3, связанных с данными персонажами. В следующих частях, я покажу некронов и гробницу. Без спойлеров -)\nБудет экшн и общий визуал будет намного лучше. Данный ролик, был для меня некой технодемо. Я понял в чем я слаб, и где совершаю ошибки, проанализировав все это, я положил начало работы над  новым роликом. \n\nЯ очень благодарен всему комьюнити вархаммер и  соц сетям. За время производства, я чувствовал колоссальную поддержку и хочу сказать спасибо!\nОбещаю следующие ролики будут намного лучше!\n\nТак же выражаю благодарность создателю канала Astartes -Syama Pedersen за вдохновение. Его работы, просто взрывают мозг. Я был вдохновлен его роликами. \n\nПриятного просмотра!\nБез жалости! Без сожалений! Без Страха!\n\n\n\n#Warhammer #Paxelart\n#Blacktemplars #Warhammer40k #Primaris",

    "videoDescription": "We took a small break from wrenching on cars because it's super hot in Georgia right now and instead worked on stuff that we could play on the lake with. I've had a 1994 Yamaha Waverunner Superjet for about 10 years now and next to my jet boat, it's the most fun thing to ever rip the water. After searching high and low for a 2020 model Superjet, I found one of the last SJ's for sale in the USA in Florida. The good homie Cletus McFarland was kind enough to pick it up from the dealer and deliver it to me. I jokingly suggested he use Leroy the Savage to pick up the new ride but I didn't think he'd actually do it. \n\nNow we have two stand-up PWC and no good way to transport them. So, we bought a cheap motorcycle trailer and modded it to carry both bikes and PWC! Skip to the end of the vid to see the on-water action or watch the whole thing to get ideas for your own conversion. \n\nStay tuned for a heads-up comparison between the old Yamaha Superjet and the new one soon!\n\nwant a shirt, hat or stickers? go here: https://www.fsmgarage.com",

    "channelDescription": "Hello there,\nWelcome to my historical sewing adventures!\n\nGenerally the garments I study (and thus, the content I produce) range from early Medieval through Edwardian: anything and everything before the widespread use of the electric sewing machine. My goal is to investigate the practices and materials used throughout history in order to better understand the clothes themselves, as well as the people who wore them. I do also make most of my everyday clothes myself--reflecting historical details, of course--so there's a bit of that round here as well.\n\nSo whether you're here here for the history--or instead wish to learn a bit of the historical origins behind these garments before adapting them to your modern needs, I bid you warmest welcomes!",

Blaine’s stunts defy the boundaries of human endurance, each one becoming more death-defying than the last.   In addition to the many millions who have seen him on television, Blaine has also performed live for audiences of over 20,000 in arenas around the world. He has performed intimately for every sitting American president including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as a number of international leaders and prominent figures such as Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, Stephen Hawking, Muhammad Ali, among others. His TED talk became one of Bill Gates’ personal favorites, and is widely considered the most revealing testimony Blaine has ever given on the topic of his remarkable career.",

Today we are looking at the return of Leeds United to the Premier League, following a chequered history that saw them almost collapse in 2007.\n\nWe break down what actually happened 16 years ago, and how financial difficulties saw them fall into the Championship and League One, from where they struggled to return. \n\nThe arrival of new Italian ownership in 2013 bought with it the promise of success, but we look at how it wasn’t until Marcelo Bielsa arrived in 2018 that hope once again gripped the famous old West Yorkshire club.\n\nWe look at the Argentines unique tactics, and how he has got the best out of the squad he was given, including the brilliant Jack Harrison and Kalvin Philips. \n\nLeeds United are a Premier League club again, and here is how that happened!\n\n\n► LISTEN TO: EXTRA TIME PODCAST: https://apple.co/2KaVq0K\n\n► FIND OUT MORE ABOUT XG & OTHER STATS FROM OUR FRIENDS 'STATS BOMB' https://statsbomb.com/articles/",

His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has continued to race in the series, racking up numerous overall wins as well as plenty of podium appearances. He’s also accumulated five X Games medals since the start of his career, including most recently taking silver at Global X Games Barcelona RallyCross in 2013. In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful viral Gymkhana series of videos.",

Get yours before they are gone at https://www.fsmgarage.com.\n\nThere is a place not far from me where the freedom echoes off the rooftops of lakefront houses, where men dare to blast across water in machines made of fiberglass, with engine's so large that the boats nearly sink under the weight of their awesomeness. We journey to Waterloo, South Carolina, to witness the spectacle of 30 hot road boats ripping across water with supercharged V8 engines belching the music of our people through open headers. It was all part of Leonard Pope's Waterloo Boogaloo hot boat party and it was incredible!\nWe saw jet boats, v-drives, tunnel hulls and hydros and we put more miles in a single day behind the wheel of Game Over than we have since its maiden voyage earlier this year. There was a food truck and live music by Testarossa, who graciously allowed us to use its tunes for the soundtrack to this video you can find them at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhmKsKVaqhZaffF7P1QYag. Hopefully we can all get together again next year for another installment of this epic day on the water. \n\n-Finnegan",

Audacity is good free audio software, and Pencil2D is free animation software that should be good enough to learn with.\n\nHave a great day! :)",

    "videoTitle": "Why You Couldn’t Afford To Fly Concorde",
    "videoDescription": "Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you’ll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustard\n\nConcorde was the world’s most iconic airliner and one of the most technically ambitious projects in aviation history. Billions were spent on its development over a span of more than a decade. When the Concorde program was launched, it was to be the next giant leap forward in air travel. Many believed that mass supersonic commercial air travel would be commonplace by the end of the 1970s. \n\nBy the early 1960s, both the British and French had come up with early designs for supersonic airliners. As both efforts moved toward the prototype phase, it increasingly made sense for the two countries to work together to shoulder development costs and the immense technical hurdles. Britain and France formally partnered to launch the Concorde program by signing a treaty in 1962.\n\nThousands of the brightest French and British engineers were dedicated to making supersonic air travel a reality. By 1963, mockups of Concorde were already capturing the world’s imagination and dazzling the press. Airlines soon placed orders for more than 70 Concordes. Orders were expected to grow to at least 200 by 1975.  The Soviet Union responded with the development of their own supersonic airliner and the United States launched the Supersonic Transport program. \n\nHowever, by the early 1970s, the prospect of mass supersonic travel began to fade. Concorde would enter commercial service in the mid-to-late 1970s, just as the price of oil began to skyrocket. Concorde burned nearly four times more fuel than even a first generation jetliner. Like all supersonic aircraft, Concorde generated sonic booms. Public tolerance for sonic booms had been underestimated, and as countries started banning supersonic flights over their airspace, limited route options made Concorde less appealing to airlines. By the end of 1973, nearly every airline cancelled their options. All the while, Concorde’s development costs had ballooned to more than ten times original estimates. \n\nBritish Airways and Air France were ultimately the only airlines to put Concordes into service, taking delivery of just a handful of aircraft each.  The two airlines would eventually turn a profit by branding Concorde as an ultra-exclusive way to travel. Ticket prices were set as high as $12,000 for a London to New York round trip for the elite few who could afford the price of flying supersonic. While the prospect of mass supersonic travel never arrived, Concorde earned a legacy as an engineering marvel and symbol of pride for the British and French until it's retirement in 2003.\n\nSelect footage courtesy the AP Archive:\nAP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovietone\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:\nhttps://twitter.com/airhrt_\n\nLink to the Mustard Store:\nhttps://teespring.com/stores/mustard-store\n\nMusic used in this production (reproduced under license):\nIntro Song:  “Upbeat Jazz” - https://audiojungle.net/item/upbeat-jazz/19560759\n\nSong 2:    “British Loop” - https://audiojungle.net/item/british-loop/3940093\n\nSong 3:    “Future Innovation Technology” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/105925303-future-innovation-technologyinspirational-science-and-indust \n\nSong 4:  “Documentary Curious And Contemporary” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/124518398-documentary-curious-and-contemporary-60-sec-part-2\n\nSong 5:   “80s Synthwave” - https://audiojungle.net/item/80s-synthwave/25916576\n\nSong 6:   “Raw Cello” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/120023244-raw-cello-virtuoso-dramatic-solo-strings-epic-inspiring-cine\n\nSong 7:   “Ambient Piano Documentary” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/123770319-ambient-piano-documentary\n\nSong 8:   “Inspirational Technology” -  https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/100434966-inspirational-technologyfuture-and-fantasyscience-and-produc\n\nSong 9:   “80s Synthwave”\nhttps://audiojungle.net/item/synthwave/26328368",

It comes with front and rear bumpers, side skirts, canards, a cf hood, and a rear wing. They also bought a set of $600 carbon fiber mirrors from Chargespeed. Shout out to our boy Tony at SocalZ who managed to track one down a wing for us that was hiding in a back room and sold it to us just in time to make this episode.\n\nNolan and Aaron are getting a $300 Duraflex N1 Body Kit. Dude, $300!! But it didn’t come with a sweet hood or wing like Hi-car’s kit did. SO, they got  a gigantic Street Faction wing and a JGTC  inspired carbon fiber hood. The wing itself was $800, which makes the wing officially the most expensive thing on Low Car. The CF hood was $540 -- It was the cheapest one we could find. Oh, and they also got some eBay KNOCKOFF ganador mirrors for $40.\n\nBody Kits are one of the coolest mods you can do to your car because it really changes the way the car looks, it almost feels like you own a new car! \n\nIs all the extra money Team Hi is throwing at their body kit actually gonna make it look THAT much better than Low Car? \n\nCheck out more Donut Media Videos: https://youtu.be/Pz8IGLgFE2s?list=PLFl907chpCa7c7xUVrvc6iXv-kWfvIdHU\r\n\r\nSome of our best videos ever are coming out soon, stay tuned so you won't miss a thing!\r\n►Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1JQ3qvO\r\n\r\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donutmedia/\r\n\r\nClick here if you want to learn more about Donut Media: http://www.donut.media/\r\n\r\nDonut Media is at the center of digital media for the next generation of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts.

    "videoDescription": "A world first. New footage from Mars rendered in stunning 4K resolution. We also talk about the cameras on board the Martian rovers and how we made the video. \n\nThe cameras on board the rovers were the height of technology when the respective missions launched.\n\nA question often asked is: \n‘Why don’t we actually have live video from Mars?’\n\nAlthough the cameras are high quality, the rate at which the rovers can send data back to earth is the biggest challenge. Curiosity can only send data directly back to earth at 32 kilo-bits per second. \n\nInstead, when the rover can connect to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we get more favourable speeds of 2 Megabytes per second. \n\nHowever, this link is only available for about 8 minutes each Sol, or Martian day. \n\nAs you would expect, sending HD video at these speeds would take a long long time. As nothing really moves on Mars, it makes more sense to take and send back images. \n\nCredit: NASA\nMusic from Epidemic Sound",

Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park artist grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.\n\nHis early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles \"Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)\" and \"All Girls Are the Same\". Both tracks would also land on his official debut full-length album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018.",

I sincerely hope you enjoy it.\nThis is a completely fan video.\nOn my patreon,  https://www.patreon.com/Primaris you can see the \"backstage\" of creating a video, various materials from Wallpapers to videos about creating soon. \nIf you want to support creating videos, I would be very grateful. This will help me speed up and focus on creating a new part.\n\nI worked on the production of the video from the beginning to the end and I hope you will appreciate the work that have done.\n\nAt this point, I have started the next part. . There will still be 3 of them associated with these characters. In the next parts, I will show the Necrons and the tomb. No spoilers)\nThere will be action and the overall visual will be much better. This video was for me some was a techno demo. I realized what I was weak at, and where I made mistakes, and after analyzing all this, I started working on a new video.\n\nI am very grateful to the entire Warhammer community and social networks. During production, I felt tremendous support and I want to say thank you!\nI promise the next videos will be much better!\n\nI also express my gratitude to the Creator of the Astartes channel-Syama Pedersen for inspiration. His work is mind-blowing. I was inspired by his videos.\n\npleasant viewing!\nNo Pity! No Remorse! No Fear!\n\nВсем привет.\n Представляю вам свой новый  проект - Примарис-черные храмовники. Это первый ролик про черных храмовников, который я  искренне надеюсь вам понравится.\nЭто полностью фан ролик. \n\nВ ближайшее время на моем патреоне https://www.patreon.com/Primaris вы сможете увидеть \"закульсье\" создания ролика, различные материалы от обоев до роликов о создании.\nЕсли вы хотите поддержать создание роликов, я буду очень признателен. Это поможет мне ускориться и сфокусироваться на создании новой части. \n\nНад производством ролика  от начала и  до конца работал только я. Надеюсь вы оцените проделанную работу.\n\nНа данный момент, я начал работать над следующей частью. Их еще будет 3, связанных с данными персонажами. В следующих частях, я покажу некронов и гробницу. Без спойлеров -)\nБудет экшн и общий визуал будет намного лучше. Данный ролик, был для меня некой технодемо. Я понял в чем я слаб, и где совершаю ошибки, проанализировав все это, я положил начало работы над  новым роликом. \n\nЯ очень благодарен всему комьюнити вархаммер и  соц сетям. За время производства, я чувствовал колоссальную поддержку и хочу сказать спасибо!\nОбещаю следующие ролики будут намного лучше!\n\nТак же выражаю благодарность создателю канала Astartes -Syama Pedersen за вдохновение. Его работы, просто взрывают мозг. Я был вдохновлен его роликами. \n\nПриятного просмотра!\nБез жалости! Без сожалений! Без Страха!\n\n\n\n#Warhammer #Paxelart\n#Blacktemplars #Warhammer40k #Primaris",

    "videoDescription": "We took a small break from wrenching on cars because it's super hot in Georgia right now and instead worked on stuff that we could play on the lake with. I've had a 1994 Yamaha Waverunner Superjet for about 10 years now and next to my jet boat, it's the most fun thing to ever rip the water. After searching high and low for a 2020 model Superjet, I found one of the last SJ's for sale in the USA in Florida. The good homie Cletus McFarland was kind enough to pick it up from the dealer and deliver it to me. I jokingly suggested he use Leroy the Savage to pick up the new ride but I didn't think he'd actually do it. \n\nNow we have two stand-up PWC and no good way to transport them. So, we bought a cheap motorcycle trailer and modded it to carry both bikes and PWC! Skip to the end of the vid to see the on-water action or watch the whole thing to get ideas for your own conversion. \n\nStay tuned for a heads-up comparison between the old Yamaha Superjet and the new one soon!\n\nwant a shirt, hat or stickers? go here: https://www.fsmgarage.com",

    "channelDescription": "Hello there,\nWelcome to my historical sewing adventures!\n\nGenerally the garments I study (and thus, the content I produce) range from early Medieval through Edwardian: anything and everything before the widespread use of the electric sewing machine. My goal is to investigate the practices and materials used throughout history in order to better understand the clothes themselves, as well as the people who wore them. I do also make most of my everyday clothes myself--reflecting historical details, of course--so there's a bit of that round here as well.\n\nSo whether you're here here for the history--or instead wish to learn a bit of the historical origins behind these garments before adapting them to your modern needs, I bid you warmest welcomes!",

Blaine’s stunts defy the boundaries of human endurance, each one becoming more death-defying than the last.   In addition to the many millions who have seen him on television, Blaine has also performed live for audiences of over 20,000 in arenas around the world. He has performed intimately for every sitting American president including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as a number of international leaders and prominent figures such as Henry Kissinger, Michael Bloomberg, Stephen Hawking, Muhammad Ali, among others. His TED talk became one of Bill Gates’ personal favorites, and is widely considered the most revealing testimony Blaine has ever given on the topic of his remarkable career.",

Today we are looking at the return of Leeds United to the Premier League, following a chequered history that saw them almost collapse in 2007.\n\nWe break down what actually happened 16 years ago, and how financial difficulties saw them fall into the Championship and League One, from where they struggled to return. \n\nThe arrival of new Italian ownership in 2013 bought with it the promise of success, but we look at how it wasn’t until Marcelo Bielsa arrived in 2018 that hope once again gripped the famous old West Yorkshire club.\n\nWe look at the Argentines unique tactics, and how he has got the best out of the squad he was given, including the brilliant Jack Harrison and Kalvin Philips. \n\nLeeds United are a Premier League club again, and here is how that happened!\n\n\n► LISTEN TO: EXTRA TIME PODCAST: https://apple.co/2KaVq0K\n\n► FIND OUT MORE ABOUT XG & OTHER STATS FROM OUR FRIENDS 'STATS BOMB' https://statsbomb.com/articles/",
